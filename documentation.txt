1) Created the environnment
2) Switched from Google Colab to local environment jupyter notebook.
3) Switched form Jupyter notebook to PyCharm.
4) Tried fixing the orientation and the size of the simulation's visuals
5) Testing the Car racing game's environment but initially giving random inputs to the car (e.g random level of acceleration, randomly applying brakes, random steering direction, etc.)
6) Facing the error stating: 'AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool8'. Did you mean: 'bool'?
'
7) Fixed the issue by making changes in the internal numpy library's file itself: replaced np.bool8 with np.bool_
8) The simulation works but the vehicle is not moving right now.
9) I have set the random values for 'throttle' and 'steering'. It is running
10) Creating a logging system that creates a new log file every new day and I can revisit my past logs as well
11) Studying the 'state' return type of my env.action(). Will possibly preprocess this and use it as input for my model
12) Thinking of DQN + PPO approach to build and train a strong model
13) Studying the 'state' N-dimensional vector. This will prove out to be helpful
14) Starting to think from first principles and am this time thinking of CNN + PPO.
15) Since I have no labelled data, I am trying to formulate an approach to build and train an agent
16) Studied stable_baseline3 library to implement PPO reinforcement learning algorithm
17) Implementing the PPO(cnn_policy) and setting things up
18) Facing multiple issues in car_dynamics.py. Fixing those internal errors manually
19) So far worked on fixing the data type issues and the incompatability with box-2d
20) Installing box2d-py, for which my linux machine required 'swig'
21) A reminder that for this project, one also needs to directly use my 'venv' because there are certain internal changes which I have made in the modules of the OpenAI's gym library and NumPy's library to handle certain compatability and type issues
