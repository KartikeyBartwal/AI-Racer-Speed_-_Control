1) Created the environnment
2) Switched from Google Colab to local environment jupyter notebook.
3) Switched form Jupyter notebook to PyCharm.
4) Tried fixing the orientation and the size of the simulation's visuals
5) Testing the Car racing game's environment but initially giving random inputs to the car (e.g random level of acceleration, randomly applying brakes, random steering direction, etc.)
6) Facing the error stating: 'AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool8'. Did you mean: 'bool'?
'
7) Fixed the issue by making changes in the internal numpy library's file itself: replaced np.bool8 with np.bool_
8) The simulation works but the vehicle is not moving right now.
9) I have set the random values for 'throttle' and 'steering'. It is running
10) Creating a logging system that creates a new log file every new day and I can revisit my past logs as well
